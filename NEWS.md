Since the spectacle of running Ã†lhometta takes most of the time, let it be a little less monotonous.

* Added total counts of `Construction` instructions during `Construct` executions, of main/alternative `Branch` choices and of `Space`-s during ticks, to statistics displayed by `@ stat tick`, which replaced `@ stat comm`.

* Fixed encoding of `IntegerToIntegerChannel`, `IntegerToIntegerIndex` and `ShiftDown`, `ShiftUp` commands accordingly to alphabetical order.
